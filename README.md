I'm a Java Developer with experience of 1.5 years in the IT industry. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet and turning problems into beautiful designs. I primarily focus on Java, HTML, SQL and now also focussing on JavaScript. While I love development and design, I'm also comfortable using front-end tech including CSS, ReactJs and JavaScript.

Transitioning to web development has enabled me to continue my lifelong passion for learning and embrace my status as a forever student. I love to work as part of a dynamic team and find the challenges that programming brings very exciting.
